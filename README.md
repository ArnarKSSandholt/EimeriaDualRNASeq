## Dual RNA-seq of an Eimeria infection of chicken cells

The aim of this project is to further understand the transcriptional profile of an Eimeria infection in chickens.  The result of the project should be a pipeline for analysing dual RNA-seq data and a better understanding of the transcriptional relationship of the two organisms during an infection.
